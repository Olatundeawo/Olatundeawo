                                                 The economy of a country, its development, its strength are all dependent, in part, on how educated its citizens are. A largely uneducated country is a country that is going nowhere. That being said, women make up at least half the entire population of Nigeria. Imagine that Nigeria is 50% male and 50% female, but of the females, only about 20% are educated as against 39% for their male counterparts. Now imagine a man with a weak right leg and a stump for the other. How shall he walk let alone run?
                                                 That is the exact state of Nigeria with more than half of its entire female population uneducated. Illiteracy of the girl child renders the majority of some 96 million Nigerians unable to contribute in substantial ways to the development of the nation economically, politically, intellectually, and in other such ways. Let’s not forget that the whole leg (the male population) is not exactly in sterling condition either. In other words, Nigeria is<a href="#girlseducation" data-toggle="collapse" class="panel-title">

                                                                      2: Girl child education most definitely improves the overall health of a family, a society, a nation ok.
                                                                      Educating the girl child contains the further spread and growth of various health hazards such as early pregnancy, female circumcision, AIDS and other STDs, diseases in children such as polio and yellow fever, etc. Child pregnancy and female circumcision are particular evils exclusive to the girl child. Especially in the northern part of Nigeria, very few girls are suffered a formal education. This is owing to cultural and religious perceptions of women and their roles in society ( perceptions that still have such deep roots in the area because of the widespread illiteracy prevalent there!). Because these families are poor and these girls are uneducated, are without prospects or any knowledge with which they can financially contribute to the family in the future, giving them out for marriage from as early as nine years of age becomes a way to obtain dowry and get by. The girls are considered to be some sort of acquired property that only pays off in the form of dowries. This translates into the reality that a disturbing 32% of teenagers in the rural areas of Nigeria have begun childbearing.
                                                                      Apart from the sad and devastating physiological and psychological effects of this outrage such as Vesico Vaginal Fistula (VVF), sexual dysfunction, and incredibly low self-esteem to name a few, there are issues born of this anomaly that affect the society on a larger scale. There’s the fact that most of these girl children with their newly born children end up begging on the streets, under the bridges, in every corner they can find. There’s the fact that these children neither how to or have the means to appropriately take care of their own children and consequently, vaccinations, proper child care, proper dieting, child health, protection from exposure, and

These girl children are not physically, financially, and emotionally equipped to have their own children. They simply end up releasing more people they cannot cater for into the world, increasing the rate of poverty by jaw-dropping numbers.

Also, education lends people (both male and female) knowledge about the evils of female gender mutilation and nary an educated person have I seen ready to surrender their girl children to be circumcised. Education affords young women knowledge about vaccinations, dieting, AIDS, proper care, knowledge that they would be well equipped with if they decide to start a family of their own. It also definitely ensures that these young women are productive and contribute to their families, to their society. Their societies then see that girl child education is an investment and choose to invest in their girls instead of simply marrying them off. The girl child becomes valuable.

                                            I went down to the river I set down on the bank.
                                            I tried to think but couldn’t,
                                            So I jumped in and sank.
                                            I came up once and hollered!
                                            I came up twice and cried!
                                            If that water hadn’t a-been so cold
                                            I might’ve sunk and died.
                                            
                                            But it was Cold in that water! It was cold!
                                            
                                            I took the elevator
                                            Sixteen floors above the ground.
                                            I thought about my baby
                                            And thought I would jump down.
                                            
                                            I stood there and I hollered!
                                            I stood there and I cried!
                                            If it hadn’t a-been so high
                                            I might’ve jumped and died.
                                            
                                            But it was High up there! It was high!

                                                 It’s a long and silent street.
I walk in the dark and trip and fall
and get up and step blindly
on the mute stones and dry leaves
and someone behind me is also walking:
if I stop, he stops;
if I run, he runs. I turn around: no one.
Everything is black, there is no exit,
and I turn and turn corners
that always lead to the street
where no one waits for me, no one follows,
where I follow a man who trips
and gets up and says when he sees me: no one.
                                          </p>

                                                 and nothing larger
                                                 my past lodges

                                                 there’d be no match

                                                 my petty traumas still

                                                 when they creak
                                                 when they moan
                                                 when they whine
                                                 there’s only one thing
                                                 i can claim these bones
                                                 are mine i tell you
